Welcome to sunburn's documentation!
===================================

``sunburn`` is a Python package aimed at facilitating the data analysis of ultraviolet spectra obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, and more specifically designed towards the study of transiting exoplanets. The code is completely object-oriented and designed to be used with Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks. If you find any bugs or have questions and feature requests, feel free to submit an `issue on GitHub <https://github.com/ladsantos/sunburn/issues>`_. ``sunburn`` is fully compatible with Python 3, and may have incompatibility issues with Python 2.
